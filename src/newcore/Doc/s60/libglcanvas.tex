\modulesynopsis{UI Control for Displaying OpenGL ES Graphics}

The \module{glcanvas} module provides a UI control, \class{GLCanvas}, for
displaying OpenGL ES graphics. \class{GLCanvas} component is similar to the
\module{appuifw} \class{Canvas} component that supports Symbian OS -level
drawing.

Internally \class{GLCanvas} uses EGL for displaying the OpenGL ES graphics. EGL,
as OpenGL ES, is a standard API defined by the Khronos Group
(www.khronos.org). Specifically, \class{GLCanvas} uses an EGL window surface,
which supports double-buffered rendering. It is possible to affect selection of
the EGL config that is used to create the window surface; for details, see the
documentation of the \class{GLCanvas} constructor.

\class{GLCanvas} instances also hold the OpenGL ES context object, which
together with the surface, are needed for rendering. When one wants to render
with a specific OpenGL ES context to a specific surface, they need to be
\emph{made current}. This also applies to \class{GLCanvas}, which has the
\code{makeCurrent} method for this purpose. Generally, calling
\code{makeCurrent} has to be done only if multiple \class{GLCanvas} objects are
used in the same program, as each \class{GLCanvas} object is automatically made
current when it is created and it remains current until it is destroyed or
\code{makeCurrent} of some other \class{GLCanvas} object is called.

\begin{classdesc}{GLCanvas}{redraw_callback, \optional{event_callback=None, resize_callback=None, attributes=None}}
Constructs a new \class{GLCanvas} object that can be used as a UI control for
displaying OpenGL ES graphics. Parameters \var{redraw_callback},
\var{event_callback}, and \var{resize_callback} have the same meaning as with
\module{appuifw} module \class{Canvas}. Using \var{redraw_callback} to specify
the OpenGL ES drawing is preferred as it will be automatically called by
\code{drawNow} method.

Parameter \var{attributes} can be used to specify attributes used in EGL config
selection. It must be a Python dictionary where keys are EGL attribute names
(which are defined in the \module{glcanvas} module) and values are integers
defining the desired attribute values. Unless specified in \var{attributes},
\code{EGL_BUFFER_SIZE} is set to value based on the display mode of the window
owned by the underlying \class{CCoeControl} object and \code{EGL_DEPTH_SIZE} is
set to 16. Attributes specified in \var{attributes} are given to
\code{eglChooseConfig}. Refer to the EGL specification for a detailed list of
config attributes and explanation of how the selection of EGL configs works.

The new \class{GLCanvas} object will be made current when the constructor
returns so \code{makeCurrent} does not have to be called before starting to use
OpenGL ES calls.

\begin{methoddesc}[GLCanvas]{bind}{key_code, c \optional{, ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))}}
Sets a callback to be called when a specific key is pressed or pointer event occurs. Parameter
\var{key_code} should be one of the standard Symbian key codes defined in
\module{key_codes}. Parameter \var{c} must be a callable object. The optional
two co-ordinate tuple corresponds to the top left and bottom right points of the
rectangle to be monitored for pointer events. This argument is ignored for Key events.

For different bind scenarios refer \class{Canvas}'s bind method.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[GLCanvas]{drawNow}{}
Calls the redraw callback (if set) and then calls \code{eglSwapBuffers} to
render and display the OpenGL ES graphics.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[GLCanvas]{makeCurrent}{}
Makes this \class{GLCanvas} object current, meaning that it will be used to
display the results of the subsequent OpenGL ES calls. In EGL terms this means
that the EGL context and surface held by this object will be passed to
\code{eglMakeCurrent}. Using \code{makeCurrent} makes it possible to use several
\class{GLCanvas} objects in a single application: the receiver of the OpenGL ES
calls can be switched with \code{makeCurrent} easily.
