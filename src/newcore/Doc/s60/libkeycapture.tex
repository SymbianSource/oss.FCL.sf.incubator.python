\modulesynopsis{Interface for global capturing of key events.}

The \module{keycapture} module offers an API for global capturing of key events. The 
\module{keycapture} module provides the \class{KeyCapturer} object as a tool for listening to 
events.

The \class{KeyCapturer} object uses a callback method to report the key 
events. The callback method is called each time any of the specified keys 
is pressed.

Currently the \module{keycapture} module does not support capturing separate key-up or
key-down events.

\begin{notice}[note]
Keycapture module requires SwEvent capability.
\end{notice}

\subsection{Module Level Constants}
The following constants are defined in the \module{keycapture} module:

\begin{datadesc}{all_keys}
A list of all key codes defined in the \module{key_codes} module.
\end{datadesc}

\subsection{KeyCapturer objects} 
\label{KeyCapturer objects}

\class{KeyCapturer} object takes a callback method as a mandatory parameter to 
its constructor. The callback method must have one single parameter for 
forwarding the key code of the captured key.

There can be several \class{KeyCapturer} objects existing at the same time.

\class{KeyCapturer} object has following methods and properties:

\begin{memberdesc}[KeyCapturer]{keys}
List of keys to be captured. Can be read and written.
\\Example:
\begin{verbatim}
keys = (key_codes.EkeyUpArrow,)
keys = keycapture.all_keys
\end{verbatim} 
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[KeyCapturer]{forwarding}
Specifies whether captured key events are forwarded to other applications or not.
Either has value 1 or 0. Can be read and written.
\end{memberdesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[KeyCapturer]{start}{}
Starts the actual capturing of key events.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[KeyCapturer]{stop}{}
Stops the actual capturing of key events.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[KeyCapturer]{last_key}{}
Returns last key code that is captured. 
\end{methoddesc}
