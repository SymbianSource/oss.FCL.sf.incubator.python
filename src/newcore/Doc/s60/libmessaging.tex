\modulesynopsis{A messaging services package.}

The \module{messaging} module offers APIs to messaging services. Currently, 
the \module{messaging} module has functions:

\begin{funcdesc}{sms_send}{number, msg, \optional{encoding='7bit', callback=None, name=""}}

Sends an SMS message with body text \var{msg}\footnote{The maximum length of a 
message that can be sent using sms_send function is either 39015 characters or Max network 
capacity whichever is lower.} (Unicode)to telephone number \var{number} (string). 

The optional parameter \var{encoding} is used to define encoding in the message. 
The parameter values can be \code{'7bit'}, \code{'8bit'} or \code{'UCS2'}.

The optional parameter \var{callback} is invoked with the current status of the 
send operation as parameter. The possible states are data items in the module 
\code{messaging}. Invoking another send while a previous send request is ongoing 
will result in \code{RuntimeError} being raised.

If the callback is not given, the \code{sms_send} function will block until the 
message in the queue is either deleted or the sending has failed\footnote{Please 
note that this blocking might last for several minutes and hence supplying the 
callback might be more suitable in many cases.}.

The optional parameter \var{name} will be shown in the sent item message entry as 
recipient's name after successfully sending message to \var{number}. If this parameter 
is not specified, then the recipient's phone number will be shown in the sent item 
message entry\footnote{The name can be of maximum 60 characters and 
will be shown in the sent item message entry as specified by sender without 
making any check in the contact database.}.

\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{mms_send}{number, msg, \optional{attachment=None}}

Sends an MMS message with body text \var{msg} (Unicode) to telephone number 
\var{number} (string). The optional parameter \var{attachment} is full path 
to e.g. image file attached to the message.

\end{funcdesc}

The following data items for SMS sending state information are available in 
the module \code{messaging}:

\begin{datadesc}{ECreated}
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{EMovedToOutBox}
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{EScheduledForSend}
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{ESent}
The SMS message has been sent.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{EDeleted}
The SMS message has been deleted from device's outbox queue. The 
\code{sms\_send} operation has finalized and subsequent SMS sending is possible.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{EScheduleFailed}
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{ESendFailed}
This state information is returned when the SMS subsystem has tried to send the message 
several times in vain. The \code{sms\_send} operation has finalized and 
subsequent SMS sending is possible.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{ENoServiceCentre}
This state information is returned by the SMS subsystem in S60 3.x emulator. In 
emulator this indicates that the \code{sms\_send} operation has finalized and 
subsequent SMS sending is possible.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{EFatalServerError}
\end{datadesc}

The underlying messaging subsystem in S60 devices might give error messages to 
the user if the device is not connected to a network while trying to send a 
message -- An "SMS send failed!" note is a common error message.

When sending messages in offline-mode or with no network connection these 
messages are actually added to an outgoing message queue and they might be sent 
if the device is later on connected to a suitable network\footnote{Note also 
that prior this the user of the device can explicitly delete the messages from 
the native messaging application. The amount of resending is approx. 4 times --
After this the sending operation is cancelled and the user of the device will 
see a visual cue of the failure in the status pane.}. This occurs despite the 
possibly misleading error messages. The current network conditions can be 
checked e.g. with \code{sysinfo.active\_profile()} and 
\code{sysinfo.signal\_bars()} invocations.

The following is example code for state information processing with 
\code{sms\_send} operation:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import messaging
>>>
>>> def cb(state):
...   if state==messaging.ESent:
...     print "**Message was sent**"
...   if state==messaging.ESendFailed:
...     print "**Something went wrong - Truly sorry for this**"
...
>>> messaging.sms_send("1234567", "Hello from PyS60!", '7bit', cb, "Mary")
>>> **Message was sent** # This is printed from the callback
\end{verbatim}
